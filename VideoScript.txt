Lighting in modern computer graphics plays a key role. For instance, take a look at this sphere

[Show unlit sphere from fig 9.1]

Without the proper lighting it's indistinguishable from a circle, as our brain lacks the 
tools it relies on to percieve depth. It is therefore, with a bit of maths, we calculate 
shading and highlights. Turning this apparent circle into what is most definitely a sphere.

But how do we calculate those two things? And how can we use it to create convincing and
appealing ligthing effects?

For the upcoming examples we will be using the local illuminations model, rather than the
global model. The main difference is that local only computes the effects of 
the given light sources on each model individually, as opposed to computing all of the 
different interactions between the models and rays of light.

As an example, these two models

...the sphere remains lit even though in reality the wall would block the light. This is the downside
of local illumination. It is however much cheaper to compute, and often prefered for real-time rendering.
